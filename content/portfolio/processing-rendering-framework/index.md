![The Processing Logo](processingLogo.png "The Processing Logo")\
A framework designed to better render graphics and physics through the Processing application.

<!--more-->

The Processing Rendering Framework is a partially developed framework that was designed to help render animations and physics dynamically. It uses objects to track the position and size of each item on the screen as well as many other attributes depending on the object type (e.g. button, Rect2D, Text2D). The system can be viewed at [GitHub](https://github.com/BigWing06/Processing-Rendering-Framework). This is an unpolished project worked on in collaberation with [BigWing06](https://github.com/BigWing06)
