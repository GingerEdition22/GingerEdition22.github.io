There are a couple of names you'll find me by:

<div class = "sectionItem">
<h3>David</h3>
<p>This one is as simple as it's my name</p>  
 </div>

<div class = "sectionItem">
<h3>Davvav</h3>
<p>This one is an inside joke. But basically it's an alternate spelling of David. It can be pronouced "DAY-vid", "DAH-vuh-vav", or "DUH-vah-v"</p>  
 </div>

<div class = "sectionItem">
<h3>GingerEdition</h3>
<p>This is the username I have on many accounts</p>  
 </div>
