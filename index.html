    <h1>Me</h1>
    <p>I have always been a fan of good design. Throughout my life I spend significant thought on ensuring everything is arranged in a logical and precise manner. This has greatly influenced my philosophy of design. Everything I design is built to look good, function nicely, and be practical in nature. This has remained especially true in the Engineering pathway. Throughout these classes I have always attempted to invest copious amounts of extra time into projects and added extra effort into ensuring every final product is to the highest standard. I have had many successes over the years, especially when it came to designing objects. I am particularly proud of my chess set and lake house. In addition I have grown and learned a lot from the Habitat For Humanity project this year. This project has allowed me to grow in my understanding of cohesive design where each section of the house plays its part. These lessons I have learned of problem solving and dedication are something that I want to carry with me into the future as I continue my educational journey at the Purdue University Department of Computer Science.</p>
